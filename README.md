# BarberDataClean

Using R and SQL to create and clean a dataset which contains the population of each county of Texas, the percentage of Texans in each county who are descendants of various races, and the number of barbers in each Texas county. I plan to use the resultant data set for either a generalized linear model or regression analysis project. 

The barber data comes from: https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/LicenseSearch/licfile.asp

The other population data comes from: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/
